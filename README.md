# Introduction  
The government of Town A government plans to add more bus stops for residents and send transportation companies to investigate. But at the moment the transport company cannot decide where the bus stops should be located; On the other hand, although the government of Town A has the residential addresses of all the residents of town A, the residents are reluctant to reveal their home addresses to an unacquainted company.  
  
In this scheme, by inputting user's geographical position coordinate data to an intermediate trust party, the trust party carries out k-means clustering calculation on all user coordinates and iterates for many times to reach the acceptable error rate. Finally, only the "cluster-center" coordinates generated by the clustering algorithm are disclosed to the transportation company, which not only provides the location strategy for the transportation company, but also protects the user's real location information from being disclosed.  
  
A镇政府拟为居民新增一些公交站点，派遣交通公司调查。但目前交通公司无法确定公交站点安排在哪个位置合适；另一方面，虽然A镇政府有A镇全体居民居住地址，但居民不愿意把家庭住址透露给外来公司。  
  
本方案通过向一个中间可信方输入用户地理位置坐标数据，由该可信方对全体用户坐标进行K-Means聚类运算，并多次迭代，达到可接受的误差率内。最终只将聚类算法生成的“簇心”坐标透露给交通公司，这样既为交通公司提供了选址策略，又保护了用户真实位置信息不被泄露。
